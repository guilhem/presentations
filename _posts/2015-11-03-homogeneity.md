## Where is the Problem?

--

* Choices never challenged
  * Belief in unchangeable paradigms
    * Creation of cross dependencies
      * Too hard to challenge choices
        * Act like paradigms are accepted

## And for DevOps?

Don't fear new ways of thinking

Experience is a damn double-edged sword

Don't try to find a silver bullet

New solution can solve 80% of problems and let 20% behind

> Errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum

- Error is part of the process. Let them fail.
- Give answer to problems when it happen
- Be wary of someone who never changes what they decided

Move fast and break things
