---

## Disclaimer

This presentation can hurt some conventionnal thoughts

---

## Agile

* Philisophy, way to think

--

* But also new roles
  * Scrum Master
  * Product Owner

---

## Devops Unicorn World

* Dev automate their application deployment.
* Ops understand business needs and contribute to design/code for production.

---

## Experience

* Each one go out its "comfort zone".
* People are less efficent than before (individually).
* No one speaks the same (human) langage.

---

## What we miss

Complexity is part of value creation. Deal with it.

--

* Hire swiss knife guys
* Create a team
* WoW you now have a (large) bottleneck

---

## Reality

* Specialization is a good way to manage complextity.
* To scale up your team, you have to deal with less open, dynamic and concerned people.

---

## Reduce your inclination

Create a new role who can be the interface between dev / ops.

--

* Application configuration
* Design
* Security
* Packaging
* Technology choices
* Monitoring
* Release Workflow

---

Think at it like someone in your team with a different background who gives you advices, is a guardrail, a universal translator
