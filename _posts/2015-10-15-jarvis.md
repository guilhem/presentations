## Me

- DevOps (sic)
- OpenVZ -> LXC -> Docker
- [www.themecloud.io](https://www.themecloud.io)
  - Was in sovereign public IaaS

---

## Openstack Components

--

- Python (mostly)
- APIs
- Stateless components

--

### Just kiding

- Queue (*MQ)
- DB (*SQL)

--

- keystone
- nova (~3)
- cinder (4)
- glance (2)
- neutron
- ceilometer (4)
- heat (4)

--

~20 + spare... -> ~60 services to manage

---

## Packaging

<p class="stretch">
![type of packaging]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/jarvis/graph.png)
</p>

---

## Legacy

- Deb Packages for openstack components
- Each service on KVM

--

### Implication

- Frozen repositories (sic)
- Custom VM hypervisor...

--

### First step - Vendorization

- All-In-One packages:
  - code
  - deps
  - libs

---

## Let's talk about boring metal

"Classical" distributions are for pets  
(they have a name, you know their mood)

By ops for ops

--

## Chromium OS / Chrome OS / Chromebooks

- Upgrade in 1 shot
- System in Read Only

--

- Less divergence
- More fiability

---

## CoreOS

- systemd
- container runner (rkt / docker)
- etcd

---

## Containers

- Server-centric
- Application-centric

---

## Docker

- Golang
- Daemon
- RESTful API
- Image format
- And more  
  <small>Registry, COW, orchestrator, SDN...</small>

--

### Docker + OpenStack (on deploy side)

Kolla

- docker images
- ansible playbook
- wrapper env -> openstack conf

--

## Fleet

<p class="stretch">
![Fleet Scheduling]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/jarvis/Fleet-Scheduling.png)
</p>

--

- sheduling
- hardware fault recovery

---

## Kubernetes <3

<p class="stretch">
![kubernetes key concepts]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/jarvis/kubernetes-key-concepts.png)
</p>

--

- Service Discovery
- Supervision
- Only etcd as stateful component

--

### OpenStack over k8s

- define your service (and way to access port / dns / IP...)
- create images who are using it

--

### Stateful components

- outside of cluster
- using new-gen proxy
- link k8s in/out with software cluster

---

## Final POC State

- lightweight bootstrapper
- 3 servers
- fleet cluster OK
- k8s cluster OK
  + HTTP gateway
  + DNS discovery
- simple keystone
- simple glance

--

From scratch with 20 man/days!

---

## Difficulties

--

OpenStack devs...

Y NO 12factor!!!

--

You can lead a horse to water but you canâ€™t make him drink
